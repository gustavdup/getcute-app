print("\n🎯 MAIN QUESTION: What happens if there are multiple images, voice notes, or images with text in a brain dump?")

print("\n📋 CURRENT BEHAVIOR:")
print("✅ Media messages during brain dump sessions are now properly handled:")
print("   • Images, voice notes, documents are accumulated like text messages")
print("   • Each media item becomes a bullet point in the consolidated note")
print("   • Voice notes are transcribed and the text is included")
print("   • Image captions become part of the content")
print("   • All hashtags from media captions are collected")
print("   • Files are saved to user's folder in Supabase storage")
print("   • No individual responses during accumulation (silent mode)")

print("\n📱 SCENARIO: Multiple Images + Voice Notes + Text")
print("   User sends: /bd #project")
print("   User sends: Image 'Design mockup v1 #ui'")
print("   User sends: Voice note (transcribed to 'This version looks good')")
print("   User sends: Text 'Need to adjust colors though #design'")
print("   User sends: Image 'Color palette ideas'")
print("   User sends: Voice note (transcribed to 'Meeting with client tomorrow')")
print("   User sends: /end")
print()
print("   CONSOLIDATED NOTE RESULT:")
print("   • 🖼️ Image: Design mockup v1")
print("   • 🎤 Voice note: This version looks good")
print("   • Need to adjust colors though")
print("   • 🖼️ Image: Color palette ideas")
print("   • 🎤 Voice note: Meeting with client tomorrow")
print("   Tags: #project, #ui, #design")

print("\n🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:")
print("   1. Media messages during brain dump go to _handle_brain_dump_media_message()")
print("   2. Files are downloaded and processed (transcription for audio)")
print("   3. Content is formatted with appropriate emoji (🎤🖼️📄)")
print("   4. Added to session metadata like text messages")
print("   5. At /end, all accumulated content becomes one consolidated note")

print("\n⚠️  LIMITATIONS:")
print("   • Images: Only captions are used, no OCR of image text yet")
print("   • Documents: Only filenames/captions, no text extraction yet")
print("   • Voice notes: Transcribed with OpenAI Whisper ✅")

print("\n🚀 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:")
print("   • OCR for images to extract text content")
print("   • Text extraction from PDF/Word documents")
print("   • Image analysis with AI to describe visual content")
print("   • Video processing and transcription")

print("\n💡 KEY BENEFIT:")
print("   Mixed media brain dumps now create searchable, consolidated notes")
print("   while preserving all individual files for reference!")
